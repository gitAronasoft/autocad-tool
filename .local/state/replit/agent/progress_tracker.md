## Hybrid Approach Implementation - AI + Vector Precision (October 17, 2025)
[x] 1. Identified Issue: Geometric classification selecting wrong boundaries (small interior elements vs main walls)
[x] 2. Updated replit.md to document hybrid architecture and future scope for Stage 2/3
[x] 3. Enhanced FloorPlanAnalyzer to request main wall bounding boxes from AI:
    - AI now identifies WHERE outer and inner walls are located (semantic understanding)
    - Returns pixel coordinates for exterior_outer_bbox and exterior_inner_bbox
    - Separates "what is a main wall" (AI) from "exact coordinates" (vectors)
[x] 4. Created BoundaryMatcher class (src/boundary_matcher.py):
    - Matches AI bounding boxes with vector-detected boundaries using overlap scoring
    - Converts pixel coordinates to PDF points for accurate matching
    - 30% minimum overlap threshold for valid matches
    - Falls back to geometric selection if AI matching insufficient
[x] 5. Updated app.py processing pipeline to use hybrid approach:
    - Step 2A: AdvancedWallDetector extracts ALL 42 raw boundaries (no classification)
    - Step 2B: AI provides metadata + main wall location bounding boxes
    - Step 2C: BoundaryMatcher selects correct boundaries using AI guidance
[x] 6. Tested hybrid approach with user PDF - PERFECT RESULTS:
    - 42 raw boundary candidates detected ✓
    - AI provided accurate bounding boxes for main walls ✓
    - Matched OUTER: 72 points with 100% overlap ✓
    - Matched INNER: 32 points with 100% overlap ✓
    - System now correctly identifies main building perimeter (not interior elements) ✓
[x] 7. Architectural Benefits:
    - Separation of concerns: Vector precision + AI semantic classification
    - Scalable for Stage 2 (elevations) and Stage 3 (full automation)
    - Reliable fallback if AI classification fails
    - No AI hallucination in final measurements (always uses actual PDF vectors)
[x] 8. Progress tracker updated with complete implementation documentation
