[x] 1. Install the required packages
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working
[x] 3. Verify the project is working using the feedback tool
[x] 4. Inform user the import is completed and they can start building, mark the import as completed using the complete_project_import tool

## Complete System Regeneration (October 8, 2025)
[x] 1. Analyzed current system issues and designed improved architecture for SaaS-ready wall boundary detection
[x] 2. Rebuilt core PDF processing engine with enhanced wall detection algorithm
[x] 3. Improved AI analysis prompts for more accurate outer and inner wall boundary detection
[x] 4. Enhanced DXF output generation with proper layer organization and highlighting
[x] 5. Updated web interface for better user experience and feedback
[x] 6. Tested the complete system with sample PDF drawings - ALL TESTS PASSED
[x] 7. Updated documentation with architect approval - PRODUCTION READY

## Import Verification (October 9, 2025)
[x] 1. Verified all packages are installed correctly
[x] 2. Confirmed Flask workflow is running successfully on port 5000
[x] 3. Tested web application interface - fully functional
[x] 4. Marked import as complete

## DXF Output Enhancement (October 9, 2025)
[x] 1. Created PDFVectorExtractor to extract actual vector content from PDFs
[x] 2. Updated AutoCADIntegration to include complete drawing in DXF (not just image reference)
[x] 3. Modified processing workflow to extract and embed vector paths from PDF
[x] 4. Tested workflow restart - system running successfully
[x] 5. Fixed 'Quad' object coordinate extraction error - now handles Point, Quad, and Rect objects
[x] 6. Enhanced rectangle handling for different PyMuPDF object types
[x] 7. Added tuple length validation to prevent index out of range errors
[x] 8. Implemented robust error handling - skips malformed paths, processes valid ones
[x] 9. Improved AI prompt for highly detailed wall boundary tracing (20-80 points per boundary)
[x] 10. Updated system to request precise coordinate points for every wall segment and corner
[x] 11. System ready for accurate wall boundary detection and highlighting

## Import Verification (October 16, 2025)
[x] 1. Verified Flask workflow is running successfully on port 5000
[x] 2. Confirmed OpenAI API key is properly configured and loaded
[x] 3. Tested web application interface - fully functional with upload capability
[x] 4. All packages installed and working correctly
[x] 5. Import migration completed successfully

## Complete Architecture Rebuild - SaaS-Ready Stage 1 (October 16, 2025)
[x] 1. Updated replit.md with complete product roadmap (Stage 1: Floor Plans, Stage 2: Elevations, Stage 3: Full Automation)
[x] 2. Created PDFProcessor service - extracts 13,099 vector paths from PDF + converts to 300 DPI image for AI
[x] 3. Created FloorPlanAnalyzer service - single optimized AI call detects floor type + traces all boundaries
[x] 4. Created DXFBuilder service - combines original PDF vectors + AI-traced boundaries into properly layered DXF
[x] 5. Updated Flask app with new clean processing pipeline and comprehensive error handling
[x] 6. Updated web interface with Stage 1 focus - clear messaging about floor plan tracing
[x] 7. Tested complete pipeline with real architectural PDF - ALL TESTS PASSED:
    - PDF: 1224x792 pt with 13,099 vector paths successfully extracted
    - AI detected: basement floor plan (95% confidence)
    - AI traced: 1 outer boundary + 3 inner boundaries + 1 garage wall
    - DXF generated: 437KB file with proper layer names (basement_exterior, basement_interior, basement_garage_wall)
    - Output format: Original drawing preserved + AI boundary highlights on named layers
[x] 8. System ready for architect review and user testing
