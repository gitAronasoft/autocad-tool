[x] 1. Install the required packages
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working
[x] 3. Verify the project is working using the feedback tool
[x] 4. Inform user the import is completed and they can start building, mark the import as completed using the complete_project_import tool

## Complete System Regeneration (October 8, 2025)
[x] 1. Analyzed current system issues and designed improved architecture for SaaS-ready wall boundary detection
[x] 2. Rebuilt core PDF processing engine with enhanced wall detection algorithm
[x] 3. Improved AI analysis prompts for more accurate outer and inner wall boundary detection
[x] 4. Enhanced DXF output generation with proper layer organization and highlighting
[x] 5. Updated web interface for better user experience and feedback
[x] 6. Tested the complete system with sample PDF drawings - ALL TESTS PASSED
[x] 7. Updated documentation with architect approval - PRODUCTION READY

## Import Verification (October 9, 2025)
[x] 1. Verified all packages are installed correctly
[x] 2. Confirmed Flask workflow is running successfully on port 5000
[x] 3. Tested web application interface - fully functional
[x] 4. Marked import as complete

## DXF Output Enhancement (October 9, 2025)
[x] 1. Created PDFVectorExtractor to extract actual vector content from PDFs
[x] 2. Updated AutoCADIntegration to include complete drawing in DXF (not just image reference)
[x] 3. Modified processing workflow to extract and embed vector paths from PDF
[x] 4. Tested workflow restart - system running successfully
[x] 5. Fixed 'Quad' object coordinate extraction error - now handles Point, Quad, and Rect objects
[x] 6. Enhanced rectangle handling for different PyMuPDF object types
[x] 7. Added tuple length validation to prevent index out of range errors
[x] 8. Implemented robust error handling - skips malformed paths, processes valid ones
[x] 9. Improved AI prompt for highly detailed wall boundary tracing (20-80 points per boundary)
[x] 10. Updated system to request precise coordinate points for every wall segment and corner
[x] 11. System ready for accurate wall boundary detection and highlighting
