## Complete Architecture Rebuild - SaaS-Ready Stage 1 (October 16, 2025)
[x] 1. Updated replit.md with complete product roadmap (Stage 1: Floor Plans, Stage 2: Elevations, Stage 3: Full Automation)
[x] 2. Created PDFProcessor service - extracts 13,099 vector paths from PDF + converts to 300 DPI image for AI
[x] 3. Created FloorPlanAnalyzer service - single optimized AI call detects floor type + traces all boundaries
[x] 4. Created DXFBuilder service - combines original PDF vectors + AI-traced boundaries into properly layered DXF
[x] 5. Updated Flask app with new clean processing pipeline and comprehensive error handling
[x] 6. Updated web interface with Stage 1 focus - clear messaging about floor plan tracing
[x] 7. Tested complete pipeline with real architectural PDF - ALL TESTS PASSED:
    - PDF: 1224x792 pt with 13,099 vector paths successfully extracted
    - AI detected: basement floor plan (95% confidence)
    - AI traced: 1 outer boundary + 3 inner boundaries + 1 garage wall
    - DXF generated: 437KB file with proper layer names (basement_exterior, basement_interior, basement_garage_wall)
    - Output format: Original drawing preserved + AI boundary highlights on named layers
[x] 8. System ready for architect review and user testing

## Final Migration Verification (October 16, 2025)
[x] 1. Verified Flask workflow running successfully on port 5000
[x] 2. Confirmed web interface is fully functional and accessible
[x] 3. Validated all features working: file upload, AI processing, DXF generation
[x] 4. All packages installed and operational
[x] 5. Project migration complete and ready for production use

## Vector-Based Wall Detection Implementation (October 16, 2025)
[x] 1. Identified GPT-4o limitation: AI returns simple rectangles instead of precise wall traces
[x] 2. Architect recommended vector-based approach using extracted PDF geometry (13,099 paths)
[x] 3. Created VectorWallDetector class to process PDF vector paths directly
[x] 4. Implemented wall filtering by stroke color (black) and line weight (â‰¥0.2pt)
[x] 5. Built segment grouping algorithm to connect wall lines into boundaries
[x] 6. Integrated vector detection into app.py processing pipeline
[x] 7. Keep AI for metadata only (floor type 95% confidence, garage detection)
[x] 8. Tested with user PDF - SUCCESSFUL DETECTION:
    - Exterior outer: 16 points (vs AI's 5 point rectangle)
    - Exterior inner: 32 points (vs AI's 5 point rectangle)
    - Interior walls: 332 boundaries detected from actual geometry
    - Original drawing preserved in ORIGINAL_DRAWING layer
    - DXF generated with accurate wall boundaries following actual drawn lines
[x] 9. System now traces ACTUAL wall geometry instead of approximations
